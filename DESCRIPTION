Description: This R package is intended for users who want to apply
    state-space universal dynamic equations (UDEs) to environmental data.
    It serves as a front-end for 'UniversalDiffEq.jl', which performs the
    machine learning algorithms in Julia on the back-end. It also
    leverages enhanced plotting features in 'ggplot2' to create
    publication-ready figures.
