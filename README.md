## emude: Environmental Modeling with Universal Dynamic Equations

This R package is intended for users who want to apply state-space universal dynamic equations (UDEs) to environmental data. It serves as a front-end for [UniversalDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/Jack-H-Buckner/UniversalDiffEq.jl), which performs the machine learning algorithms in Julia on the back-end. It also leverages the enhanced plotting features in ggplot2 to create publication ready figures.
