\title{Plot two-dimensional phase plane}
\usage{
phase_plane_2D(observations, names, values, x, y, predictions = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{observations}{A data frame of observed values over time.}

\item{names}{The column in \code{observations} containing the identifier for the
response variable (e.g., series or species name).}

\item{values}{The column in \code{observations} containing the values for the
response variable (e.g., species abundances).}

\item{x}{The state variable to be displayed on the x-axis.}

\item{y}{The state variable to be displayed on the y-axis.}

\item{predictions}{A data frame of predicted values over time, with column
names matching the column names of \code{observations}. Optional.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} figure showing the phase plane of observations and model
predictions. Can be adjusted with additional \code{ggplot2} functions.
}
\description{
\code{phase_plane_2D()} creates a two-dimensional phase plane showing how the two
state variables co-occur at each time point. Observations are plotted as points
and model predictions as lines.
}
\details{
As with \code{ggplot2} aesthetics, do not enclose the column names in quotes.

\examples{
df <- data.frame("time" = rep(seq(1,100),4),
                 "species" = c(rep("A",100),rep("B",100),rep("C",100),rep("D",100)),
                 "abundance" = c(rpois(200,40),rpoise(200,10))
phase_plane_2D(observations = df, names = species, values = abundance,
               x = A, y = B)
