\title{Plot time series}
\usage{
series_plot(observations, x, y, group, predictions = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{observations}{A data frame of observed values over time.}

\item{x}{The column in \code{observations} containing the values for the time
variable (e.g., days), which will be displayed on the x-axis.}

\item{y}{The column in \code{observations} containing the values for the response
variable (e.g., species abundances), which will be displayed on the y-axis.}

\item{group}{The column containing the identifier for the response variable
(e.g., series or species name). Also defaults to the color scheme, but this
can be adjusted with user-defined call to \code{aes(color = variable)}.}

\item{predictions}{A data frame of predicted values over time, with column
names matching the column names of \code{observations}. Optional.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} figure showing the time series of observations and model
predictions. Can be adjusted with additional \code{ggplot2} functions.
}
\description{
\code{series_plot()} creates a time series figure with observations as points and
model predictions as lines.
}
\examples{
df <- data.frame("time" = rep(seq(1,100),4),
                 "species" = c(rep("A",100),rep("B",100),rep("C",100),rep("D",100)),
                 "abundance" = rpois(400,40))
series_plot(observations = df, x = "time", y = "abundance", group = "species")
