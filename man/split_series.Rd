\title{Split time series}
\usage{
split_series(
  df,
  time_column_name = "time",
  series_column_name = "series",
  train_frac = 0.8
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame with any dimensions containing \code{time_column_name} and observations. The \code{series_column_name} is optional; if not found, the entire data frame is treated as one series.}

\item{time_column_name}{The column that contains the time data, indicating when the observations were made.}

\item{series_column_name}{The column that contains the series data, indicating the identifying information for the observations. Optional.}

\item{train_frac}{The proportion [0,1] of observations that represents data used for training and validation. The testing data are calculated as the remaining proportion.}
}
\value{
A list containing two data frames: \code{train} and \code{test}.
}
\description{
\code{split_series()} separates the complete time series into training data and testing data.
It will group the dataset based on the series column information, and then split
based on the provided training fraction, with a default of 80\%/20\% for training/testing.

\examples{
print("test")
